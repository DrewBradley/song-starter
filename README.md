## Introduction

Hate starting new songs? Get started!

Starting a new song can be hard. Your lyrics feel uninspired. You keep falling into the same chord progressions. It's too hard to be original. Let the app do the work for you.

## Features

Users can create a song at the click of a button!
Users can choose which key to write their song in, and choose between major and minor.
If a user wants to add a little spice, they can opt to use seventh chords!
A song is generated with four lines of poetry, and a set of four chords.
Users can play the chords by click on them!
If a user wishes to, they can view the full poem they were given, OR choose to write their own lyrics.
Songs can be daved and retrieved at a later date, thanks to local storage.
